# Kronoberg Tourist Chatbot with Facebook Messenger platform

This is our group project in the course Adaptive and Semantic Webhooks at Linnaeus Univeristy.

The chatbot users can chat with the bot and get information about Kronoberg 
that can be good to know when traveling to Kronoberg as a tourist.

Group members: Linnea Str√•gefors, Nurane Kuqi and Natali Asher
